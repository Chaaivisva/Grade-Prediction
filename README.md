# Grade-Prediction
Grade Prediction uses ML to estimate student grades based on factors like attendance, study hours, and stress levels. It preprocesses data by encoding categorical and scaling numerical features. A Decision Tree model is trained to make accurate predictions for new student data, helping assess performance and identify areas for improvement.
